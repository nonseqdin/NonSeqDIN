This directory includes some scripts for preprocessing the Alipay and Taobao datasets.

> Because we used an internal training framework, the model training data was imported into Aliyun's MaxCompute system after the results generated by  taobao_prepare_1.py and alipay_prepare_1.py are ready.
> It is difficult to preprocess Alimama dataset on a single machine. After importing the downloaded original data into the MAXCOMPUTE system, the processing is realized through SQL.
